// created from the OSX-specific code from Mozilla's mozilla::fallocation() function
// of which the licensing information is copied above.
// Adaptation (C) 2015,2016 R.J.V. Bertin


// From Linux `man posix_fallocate`:
// DESCRIPTION
//        The function posix_fallocate() ensures that disk space is allocated for
//        the file referred to by the descriptor fd for the bytes  in  the  range
//        starting  at  offset  and continuing for len bytes.  After a successful
//        call to posix_fallocate(), subsequent writes to bytes in the  specified
//        range are guaranteed not to fail because of lack of disk space.
// 
//        If  the  size  of  the  file  is less than offset+len, then the file is
//        increased to this size; otherwise the file size is left unchanged.

// From OS X man fcntl:
//      F_PREALLOCATE      Preallocate file storage space. Note: upon success, the space
//                         that is allocated can be the same size or larger than the space
//                         requested.
//      The F_PREALLOCATE command operates on the following structure:
//              typedef struct fstore {
//                  u_int32_t fst_flags;      /* IN: flags word */
//                  int       fst_posmode;    /* IN: indicates offset field */
//                  off_t     fst_offset;     /* IN: start of the region */
//                  off_t     fst_length;     /* IN: size of the region */
//                  off_t     fst_bytesalloc; /* OUT: number of bytes allocated */
//              } fstore_t;
//      The flags (fst_flags) for the F_PREALLOCATE command are as follows:
//            F_ALLOCATECONTIG   Allocate contiguous space.
//            F_ALLOCATEALL      Allocate all requested space or no space at all.
//      The position modes (fst_posmode) for the F_PREALLOCATE command indicate how to use
//      the offset field.  The modes are as follows:
//            F_PEOFPOSMODE   Allocate from the physical end of file.
//            F_VOLPOSMODE    Allocate from the volume offset.

// From OS X man ftruncate:
// DESCRIPTION
//      ftruncate() and truncate() cause the file named by path, or referenced by fildes, to
//      be truncated (or extended) to length bytes in size. If the file size exceeds length,
//      any extra data is discarded. If the file size is smaller than length, the file 
//      extended and filled with zeros to the indicated length.  The ftruncate() form requires
//      the file to be open for writing.
//      Note: ftruncate() and truncate() do not modify the current file offset for any open
//      file descriptions associated with the file.
